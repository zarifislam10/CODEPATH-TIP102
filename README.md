LeetCode-style practice problems from CodePath TIP 102, solved collaboratively in weekly peer groups. Each session builds core DSA fundamentals in Python.

# CodePath TIP 102: LeetCode-Style Practice

This repository contains my weekly LeetCode-style problem-solving sessions from the CodePath Technical Interview Prep (TIP) 102 course.

## ðŸ“š About the Course
CodePath TIP 102 is designed to strengthen problem-solving skills in preparation for software engineering internships. Each week, I worked on sets of curated algorithm questions with a new group of peers, focusing on:
- Collaboration
- Communication of problem-solving approaches
- Mastery of core data structures and algorithms

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered
- Arrays & Strings
- Hash Maps & Sets
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Prefix Sums
- Binary Search
- Sorting & Greedy Algorithms
- Stacks & Queues (more as the course progresses)

Each file contains multiple problems with code and comments, reflecting collaborative efforts and solutions developed during the session.

## ðŸ‘¥ Collaboration
Throughout the course, I worked with a rotating set of peers to simulate whiteboarding and peer programming interviews. This improved both my technical fluency and my ability to explain ideas clearly.

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms
- Prepare for upcoming technical interviews
- Practice collaborating in technical settings
